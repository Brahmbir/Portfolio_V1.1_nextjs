To create a professional portfolio website to showcase your projects and skills, I created this site.

With `Next.js` SSR capabilities, it ensures lightning-fast load times and optimal **SEO** performance and stunning animations and transitions by `Framer Motion.js` to build a dynamic and responsive website .

First install all Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
